<h1><font face="MV Boli">"FITNESS IS NOT QUITING,IT'S GETTING UP ONE MORE TIME"</font></h1>
<p><font size = "6px"face="Bradley Hand ITC"><p> The hardest part of losing weight, eating right and getting in shape is not the exercise.It’s in your head – it’s understanding and remembering the benefit of physical fitness. It’s that mental barrier that many people fail to knock down.When we come home from work, tired, fed up and starving it’s the barrier that stops us from preparing the right meal. Instead, we opt for eating junk food until the void is filled. For now,the number one cure for this problem is to have a fitness buddy to encourage you, pick you up when you’re feeling down and maybe even shame you for not going for that run. But we don’t all have those. That’s where the magic of the Interwebs comes in.</p></font>
