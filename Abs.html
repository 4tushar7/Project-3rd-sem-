<hr color="white">
<h3>Abs Anatomy</h3>
<p>The routine is composed of 7 abdominal exercises carefully chosen to hit both the upper and lower abs. Use them to get a ripped core!</p><br>
<p>How do you train your abs? You can make your ab training long and complicated, like many people do, but in my book, the best ab workout is the one you'll do over and over again.</p><br>

<p>Yes, it's true that that abs are earned in the kitchen, but if a six-pack is your goal, it's also important to pick the right ab workout for the job.</p><br>
<p>This routine is composed of seven abdominal exercises carefully chosen to work both the upper and lower abs. Hit it hard three times a week, along with a healthy diet, some lifting, and the right amount of cardio, and you'll see your abs soon enough.</p><br><br>
<ol type="1">
<li>Sit-Up</li>
<ol type="i">
<li>Lie down on the floor placing your feet either under something that will not move or by having a partner hold them. Your legs should be bent at the knees.</li>
<li>Place your hands behind your head and lock them together by clasping your fingers. This is the starting position.</li>
<li>Elevate your upper body so that it creates an imaginary V-shape with your thighs. Breathe out when performing this part of the exercise.</li>
<li>Once you feel the contraction for a second, lower your upper body back down to the starting position while inhaling.</li>
<li>Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.</li>

<h3>Variations:</h3>
<ul>
<li>This exercise can be performed with a weighted plate being held by both arms resting on the chest. The way to perform this exercise is to cross your arms by making an X and grabbing the weighted plate. Note: Your hands will no longer be behind your head.</li>
<li>This variation may be difficult to perform at first so start out using little to no weights until you feel comfortable with the movements.</li>
</ul><br><br>
<li>Leg Raise</li>
<ol type"i">
<li>Lie with your back flat on a bench and your legs extended in front of you off the end.</li>
<li>Place your hands either under your glutes with your palms down or by the sides holding on to the bench. This will be your starting position.</li>
<li>As you keep your legs extended, straight as possible with your knees slightly bent but locked raise your legs until they make a 90-degree angle with the floor. Exhale as you perform this portion of the movement and hold the contraction at the top for a second.</li>
<li>Now, as you inhale, slowly lower your legs back down to the starting position.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Variations:</h3>
<p>You can also perform this exercise on the floor on top of an exercise mat. You can also add weight by holding a dumbbell in between your feet as you get more advanced.</p><br><br>
<li>Jackknife Sit-Up</li>
<ol type="i">
<li>Lie flat on the floor (or exercise mat) on your back with your arms extended straight back behind your head and your legs extended also. This will be your starting position.</li>
<li>As you exhale, bend at the waist while simultaneously raising your legs and arms to meet in a jackknife position. Tip: The legs should be extended and lifted at approximately a 35-45 degree angle from the floor and the arms should be extended and parallel to your legs. The upper torso should be off the floor.</li>
<li>While inhaling, lower your arms and legs back to the starting position.</li>

<ol type="i">
<li>Lie on an exercise mat or a flat bench with your legs off the end.</li>

<li>Bend your knees and pull your upper thighs into your midsection as you breathe out. Continue this movement until your knees are near your chest. Hold the contracted position for a second.</li>
<li>As you breathe in, slowly return to the starting position. </li>

<h3>Variations:</h3>
<p>As you get more advanced, you can hold a dumbbell between your legs. You can also perform this exercise on a decline bench.</p><br><br>
<li>Toe Toucher</li>
<ol type="i">
<li>To begin, lie down on the floor or an exercise mat with your back pressed against the floor. Your arms should be lying across your sides with the palms facing down.</li>
<li>Your legs should be touching each other. Slowly elevate your legs up in the air until they are almost perpendicular to the floor with a slight bend at the knees. Your feet should be parallel to the floor.</li>
<li>Move your arms so that they are fully extended at a 45 degree angle from the floor. This is the starting position.</li>
<li>While keeping your lower back pressed against the floor, slowly lift your torso and use your hands to try and touch your toes. Remember to exhale while perform this part of the exercise.</li>
<li>Slowly begin to lower your torso and arms back down to the starting position while inhaling. Remember to keep your arms straight out pointing towards your toes.</li>
<li>Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.</li>
</ol>

<li>Crunches</li>
<ol type="i">
<li>Lie flat on your back with your feet flat on the ground, or resting on a bench with your knees bent at a 90 degree angle. If you are resting your feet on a bench, place them three to four inches apart and point your toes inward so they touch.</li>
<li>Now place your hands lightly on either side of your head keeping your elbows in. Tip: Don't lock your fingers behind your head.</li>
<li>While pushing the small of your back down in the floor to better isolate your abdominal muscles, begin to roll your shoulders off the floor.</li>
<li>Continue to push down as hard as you can with your lower back as you contract your abdominals and exhale. Your shoulders should come up off the floor only about four inches, and your lower back should remain on the floor. At the top of the movement, contract your abdominals hard and keep the contraction for a second. Tip: Focus on slow, controlled movement - don't cheat yourself by using momentum.</li>
<li>After the one second contraction, begin to come down slowly again to the starting position as you inhale.</li>
<li>Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.</li>
</ol>

<li>Move your legs up so that your thighs are perpendicular to the floor and feet are together and parallel to the floor. This is the starting position.</li>
